Generic single-database configuration.

Current head: 2026_01_29_baseline (see versions/2026_01_29_baseline_current_schema.py).
New migrations should set down_revision = "2026_01_29_baseline" (or the current head).
Schema is created by app startup (init_db); run "alembic upgrade head" to record version.
