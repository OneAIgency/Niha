---

SECTION 1: PRODUCT SPECIFICATION

1.1 EU Allowance Definition

(a) **Definition:** "EUA" means an EU Allowance issued under the EU Emissions Trading System per Directive 2003/87/EC, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067, and related regulations.

(b) **Characteristics:** All EUA supplied by Nihao shall have the following characteristics:
    - Valid and properly issued by competent EU authority
    - Free and clear of any liens, encumbrances, or security interests
    - Freely transferable without restriction
    - Eligible for immediate surrender or trading per EU ETS regulations
    - Not previously surrendered, cancelled, or retired

(c) **Vintage:** EUA vintage shall be 2023 or later unless otherwise specified in Trade Confirmation.

(d) **Quantity:** Expressed in whole units. Fractional units not permitted.

(e) **Fungibility:** All EUA are fungible and interchangeable. No serial number tracking or individual unit identification required.

1.2 Quality Assurance

(a) **Registry Verification:** All EUA shall be verified in the Union Registry as valid and unencumbered prior to delivery.

(b) **Title Verification:** Nihao warrants clear, unencumbered title to all EUA prior to transfer to Client.

(c) **Compliance:** All EUA comply with applicable EU ETS regulations and do not violate any sanctions, embargoes, or trade restrictions.

(d) **Non-Counterfeit:** All EUA are genuine and not counterfeit or fraudulent.

1.3 CEA-to-EUA Swap Structure

(a) **Underlying Asset:** EUA are sourced through acquisition of Chinese Emission Allowances (CEA) from regulated Chinese entities and subsequent swap for EUA through authorized counterparties.

(b) **Swap Process:**
    - CEA acquired at Chinese national registry
    - CEA transferred to designated swap counterparty
    - Swap counterparty delivers equivalent EUA in return
    - EUA transferred to Client's Union Registry account

(c) **Swap Ratio:** Ratio determined commercially at time of transaction. Example: 1.05 CEA : 1.00 EUA (indicating 5% variation between CEA and EUA values).

(d) **Black Box Structure:** Client acknowledges that Nihao does not provide real-time visibility into intermediate CEA holdings or swap counterparty operations. Client relies on Nihao's attestation of CEA acquisition and final EUA delivery.

(e) **No Guarantees:** Nihao makes no guarantee regarding:
    - CEA-to-EUA swap ratios or fairness of ratios
    - Specific counterparty identities (may vary by transaction)
