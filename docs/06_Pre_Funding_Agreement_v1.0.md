    - SWIFT Charges: EUR 25-50
    - **Estimated Total Cost per Wire:** EUR 50-100
    - Client should instruct sending bank to include fees in transfer amount (not deduct from amount)

(c) **Processing Timeline:**
    - International wire transfers typically take 2-5 business days
    - Processing time depends on sending bank, intermediary banks, and receiving bank
    - Delays occur for compliance review, FX conversion, or processing backlogs
    - Nihao has no control over banking processing delays

(d) **Wire Transfer Confirmation:**
    - Upon sending wire transfer, Client receives SWIFT confirmation from bank
    - Client forwards confirmation to: deposits@nihaogroup.hk
    - Nihao reconciles incoming funds with SWIFT confirmations
    - Typically reconciled within 24 hours of receipt

1.2 Foreign Currency Deposits

(a) **Currency Conversion:**
    - Escrow Account maintained in EUR
    - If Client deposits in USD, GBP, or other currency: conversion required
    - Conversion occurs at Escrow Bank's FX desk

(b) **FX Conversion Rate Determination:**
    - **Conversion Rate:** Interbank spot rate at 10:00 HK time on deposit date
    - **FX Markup:** 0.25% applied to interbank rate (standard market markup)
    - **Total Effective Rate:** Interbank rate + 0.25% markup
    - Both rates documented in confirmation email to Client

(c) **FX Conversion Example:**
    - Client deposits: USD 60,000
    - Interbank rate at 10:00 HKT: 1 EUR = 1.0850 USD
    - Calculation: USD 60,000 ÷ 1.0850 = EUR 55,286.12 (interbank equivalent)
    - FX Markup: EUR 55,286.12 × 0.25% = EUR 138.22
    - **EUR Amount Credited:** EUR 55,286.12 – EUR 138.22 = EUR 55,147.90

(d) **FX Markup Justification:**
    - 0.25% markup covers bank's FX dealing costs
    - Standard in financial markets (not excessive)
    - Lower than typical retail FX markups (0.5-1.0%)
    - Applied uniformly to all Client FX deposits

(e) **No Favorable Rates:**
    - Nihao does not negotiate favorable FX rates
    - Client receives standard interbank rates + standard markup
    - No preferential pricing available

    - Hold Period: 1 business day (faster processing after initial KYC)
    - Purpose: Routine compliance verification
